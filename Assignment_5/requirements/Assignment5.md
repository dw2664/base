## Project Guidelines

This document has to be sent to the instructors and it has to be approved before Monday November 22, 2021. The grade of the final project will be given depending on the correctness and completeness of the graphics part of the project (wrt the project overview). Only the parts that are related to computer graphics will be graded.

## Software Libraries

You are free to use any software library you want, as long as it is detailed in the project overview and approved by the instructors.

## Minimal Requirements

The project must use either ray tracing or rasterization to render a scene. The project must use at least one technique that has not been already covered in the previous assignments (i.e. texture mapping, advanced shaders, procedural geometry/materials, virtual reality, raster transparency, raster shadows, or any other technique that is approved by the instructors).
